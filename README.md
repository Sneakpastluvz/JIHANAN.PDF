***If you came here from Pony Town, This place is all you need to know about me there***

---------------------------------

***Boundaries Meaning (on my name):***

INT (Interact)

C+H (Cuddles + Hiding)

TC (Touch Comfort)

DBLsW2I (Doubles Whisper to Interact, if you have the same character as me, it would be nice if you notify it by whispering me)

RPDNIUC (Roleplay Do Not Interact Unless Close)

DNCUVC (Do Not Copy Unless Very Close)

---------------------------------

Other than Touching/Cuddling/Hiding behind me (TC, C+H), you can as well give things/Whisper/Befriend/Ask/Compliment me freely, just don't make me feel uncomfortable

But if you ask me to join your party, It depends on my response; if I'm in a party and can't leave, I'll say that. But if I just don't feel like it, I'll say that as well, etc. so please beware

I always wanted someone to talk to me, so my status is always "Looking for chat", but even with that status, I want people to interact with me first cuz I'm not good to strangers
